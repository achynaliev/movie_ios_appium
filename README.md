2.To run first scenario exec "cucumber -p count
For the first scenario I just counted number of cells that represent movie.

3.To run second scenario type in "cucumber -p info
Second scenario I print out value from element
for rating I did remove first character using string methods .reverse.chop.reverse

4.To run third scenario type in "cucumber -p best
I created an array and each type I was getting an value I was adding it to my array, And then I chop the first non-decimal character and convert string to float using .to_f method.
And eventually I have an Array of floats and I use array method .max to get the greatest float of my array.
